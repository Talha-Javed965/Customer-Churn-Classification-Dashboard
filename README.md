# Customer-Churn-Classification-Dashboard
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, especially in competitive markets like e-commerce. Understanding why customers leave and identifying those at risk can significantly improve retention strategies, reduce revenue loss, and optimize marketing efforts. This project aims to develop a Customer Churn Classification Dashboard that classifies customers as "likely to churn" or "likely to stay" based on their behavior and activity data.

Two Machine Learning models have been utilized for this project to make predictions, randon forest model and XGBoost model, 
Both models were evaluated using confusion matrix,classification report and random_forest/XGBoost- accuracy
SHAP(SHaply addiction exPlainer) was utilized for model interpretability
 Summary plot and Force plot were used.
In the end if user enter  entirely new input, the system respond with whether the customer churn/or not
